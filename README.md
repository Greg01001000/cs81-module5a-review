### CS 81, Module 5 Assignment 5A: Code Review, by GregH, 7/14/25

**hobbyTracker.js** has sample data to create a log of time spent on various hobbies each day, and moods. It also has custom functions which use the filter, reduce, and map higher-order functions to produce analysis of the sample data, and sample output statements calling the custom functions. I added explanatory code comments, a suggestion, and an additional output statement with a function call with a different argument and output format.

**REFLECTION.md** answers questions about what I learned and what was confusing to me.
